 * Keyboard and mouse bindings, the way Dark Souls III PC keeps them (after droogie's bbhost,
 * host/bindings.cpp): every action takes up to three bindings, each one a key or a mouse input
 * on its own or a combination held together, and each sets the pad bit (or stick direction) the
 * game reads for it. They apply on top of a connected gamepad, so both work at once.
 *
 * bbport.ini: key_<action>=<binding>, <binding>, <binding>
 *   A binding is one input, or up to three joined with '+' that must all be held ("Left
 *   Shift+Mouse2": Shift and the right button together). An input is a key's SDL name
 *   ("W", "Left Alt", "Keypad 4") or Mouse1..Mouse5 (left, right, middle, the two side
 *   buttons) and WheelUp / WheelDown; "none" unbinds. Commas separate bindings, so the first
 *   one can be a key and the next a mouse button:
 *     key_interact=E                          one binding
 *     key_firearm=X, Mouse2                   either one presses L2
 *     key_strong_attack=Left Shift+Mouse1     Shift and left click together press R2
 *     key_gestures=none                       unbound
 *   A binding that is held wins over the bindings on its own inputs: with
 *   key_strong_attack=Left Shift+Mouse1 and key_attack=Mouse1, Shift + left click is R2 only.
 *   A key given to one action is taken from any other (combinations keep their parts, so a
 *   modifier can serve several of them). */
